## Edge Cases Not Covered
- **Screenshot method fallback chains**
  - Unknown method fallback to screenshot_adb
  - Method failure cascading
  - Platform-specific method selection

- **Concurrent access to screenshot methods**
  - Multiple threads taking screenshots
  - Resource contention handling
  - State consistency during concurrent access

- **Memory pressure during long-running operations**
  - Screenshot deque overflow behavior
  - Memory cleanup on errors
  - Resource leak prevention

- **Network timeouts in OCR operations**
  - OCR backend connection failures
  - Timeout handling in OCR processing
  - Fallback to alternative OCR backends

- **Configuration edge cases**
  - Invalid configuration values
  - Missing configuration files
  - Configuration reload during operation

- **Error recovery edge cases**
  - Multiple consecutive errors
  - Error during error recovery
  - Resource cleanup on recovery failure

## Platform-Specific Code Not Tested
- **Windows-specific screenshot methods**
  - Windows-only code paths
  - Windows emulator integration
  - Windows-specific error handling

- **Linux-specific behavior**
  - Linux ADB integration
  - Linux-specific file paths
  - Linux permission handling

- **Android version compatibility**
  - Different Android API levels
  - Emulator version differences
  - Device-specific quirks

## Performance-Critical Paths Not Tested
- **Screenshot capture performance**
  - Method selection performance impact
  - Retry overhead measurement
  - Memory usage during retries

- **OCR processing performance**
  - Large image processing
  - Batch OCR operations
  - Memory usage during OCR

- **Timer accuracy**
  - Timer precision verification
  - System clock changes
  - High-frequency timer usage

## Integration Points Not Tested
- **Screenshot → OCR pipeline**
  - Image format compatibility
  - Color space conversion
  - Resolution handling

- **Config → Device initialization**
  - Configuration value propagation
  - Invalid configuration handling
  - Configuration change detection

- **Error → Recovery → Retry chains**
  - Multi-level error recovery
  - Recovery strategy effectiveness
  - Retry limit enforcement

## Test Quality Issues
- **Insufficient mocking**
  - External dependencies not properly mocked
  - Side effects not isolated
  - State pollution between tests

- **Missing assertions**
  - Tests that don't verify outputs
  - Tests that only check for exceptions
  - Tests that don't validate state changes

- **Poor test isolation**
  - Tests that depend on external state
  - Tests that modify global state
  - Tests that depend on execution order

## Recommendations
1. **Prioritize critical path testing**: Focus on Screenshot.screenshot() and Device.stuck_record_check()
2. **Add behavioral verification**: Replace import-only tests with actual behavior testing
3. **Implement proper mocking**: Isolate units under test from external dependencies
4. **Add integration testing**: Test component interactions with real data flows
5. **Performance testing**: Add timing and memory usage verification
6. **Platform testing**: Add platform-specific test scenarios
7. **Error simulation**: Test all error paths with proper recovery verification
