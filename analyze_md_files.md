Analyze all .md files in this project and identify which ones are obsolete or candidates for deletion. For each file:

1. Determine if the content is still relevant to the current project state
2. Check if it references outdated features, deprecated modules, or old workflows
3. Identify if it duplicates information found elsewhere
4. Note if it contains only temporary notes or development artifacts
5. Assess if it provides value to current or future developers

Categorize files as:
- KEEP: Essential documentation that is current and valuable
- DELETE: Obsolete, outdated, or redundant files
- REVIEW: Files that need manual review to determine their fate

Provide specific reasons for each recommendation.
